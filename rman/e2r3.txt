Black dye
She stood again
Life is easy
I learn Romanian
A different man
Different from me
They are mine
A place in Romania
I see them
Let me see you
She wears shirts
My room's door
I need my phone
I close the door
I need to close it
It leads to my room
I'm standing outside
It's hot outside
Every day
Blue sky
because he died
the best room
his hands

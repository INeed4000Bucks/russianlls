Platonix sex

Alex is an actor for a living. He often asks the director to make it so that he can fuck the children.
Alex gets sexual with Emma all the time. She interprets it platonically.
Every woman interprets it platonically
This mixes with gullibility kink
If they don't do what you ask right away, just give them a reason. Shouldn't be too long. The apprehension is the exciting chase.

Examples:
Getting girls to fuck at improv; sex during improv isn't real sex so it's platonic
Asking for script changes in films to include more sex for your character
Convincing class of girls to fuck you for educational purposes
Convincing a girl at a gym to let you hold her breasts for support so they don't bounce so much
Fucking girls in a book club so you can show them how book characters have sex

I change ending of first chapter:
“The disrespect, man. It's unbelievable. It's sexism at play if you ask me.” Alex thought for only a brief moment and spoke up once again before Kaycee could complain some more about the class and how she only laughs at their jokes to be nice. “You know what? Let’s ditch those persecuting pervs. I actually wanna do something like improv with you but I wanna film it.”

“The disrespect, man. It's unbelievable. It's sexism at play if you ask me.” Alex thought for only a brief moment and spoke up once again before Kaycee could complain some more about the class and how she only laughs at their jokes to be nice. “And you know what? I'm sexist too,” I teased, “I don't think you could beat me to the car 'cause you're a girl!”

And with that he bolted to the car with Kaycee yelling after him.

Second chapter: Alex is in a movie. He decides to fuck both actresses.

"Three, Two, One, Action!"

"Martha... you didn't marry a ghoul. You married a fool!"

Two girls sat in a dark living room watching the cheesiest horror movie ever concieved. It has to be this bad, just so it's not confused with the real horror movie; the one where a crouched and bottomless Alex is sneaking up to his costars, fixing to give them a good scare.

His costars, an olive-skinned Greek girl named Marina and a Kazakh girl called Kymbat, couldn't hear him over the -"Frank, I married somebody who'll allow me to rule... the underworld. Is that not ghoulish enough for you?"

And it was when the real ghoul was revealed in a shock twist that a flash of lightning revealed the even realer Alex appeared in the scene next to the couch, causing the girls to hug each other and scream in his direction. They put on their best frightened, wide-eyed faces for the camera. Alex had changed the script so that the girls would remain seated on the couch instead of scrambling away. For his convenience, of course.

Thanks to the light eminating from the set's TV, the girls could easily see his chubbed immodesty, hanging at them. His wiener being out was another, even larger change to the script. Naturally, each change he made just helped the movie fit his tastes better, and he had explained to the director that what matches your tastes perfectly is sure to captivate many others as well, and they may as well change a few things here and there for the guy who is clearly the most invested in the script compared to the other actors.

The dialogue of the mock movie made way for Alex as he explained himself to the girls. "OoOoOh, I am the cryptid ghost of this houseEeEe."

"Please don't hurt us!" the Marina begged. Even her scared grimace is pretty enough to be a lead in a movie, which is why she's here. She hugged the trembling Kymbat even tighter.

"You wanna get rid of me? Well all you have to do is suck the life force out of me through my coOoOck. Once both of you have swallowed enough life force, you will have the joint power to deliber me into the next reaAaAlm." (The bad guy giving away his weakness was not originally part of the script)

Marina took charge of the situation: "I'm gonna suck your dick first!" she said bravely. She let go of Kymbat and plopped down next to the edge of the couch, which Alex's cock was protruding over. She grabbed his junk and started working her tongue over and around it to get it to full mast. Soon enough everyone was just watching Marina straight up blow Alex in the name of all that is acting. This was to be expected though. Alex had told the director right away that he definitely wanted plenty of blowjobs scenes in the movie. The blowjobs were written in the script before the reason for them being there was.

"Hollowed out cheeks, don't forget... Yeah that's good." Marina's arms rested on the arm of the couch as she leaned over and sucked Alex off. The position strained her, but she worked with confidence, making the right amount of eye contact with him as they practiced dozens of times.

Kymbat takes a spot closer to the action, saying, "Oh, make sure you're doing it right. We really want this guy out of here!" Alex assured the director that infusing her meeker personality in every single line was in poor taste.
